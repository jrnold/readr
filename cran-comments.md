## R CMD check results
I Jim Hester am taking over maintenance of the readr package from Hadley, there
is one NOTE to this effect.

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There were no warnings from UBSAN and ASAN run on R-hub
(https://builder.r-hub.io/status/readr_1.0.0.9000.tar.gz-7308f26232304b308e6f3949f0e69d75).

## Reverse dependencies

* I ran R CMD check on all 84 reverse dependencies
  Results at https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/blob/master/revdep/

* There were 8 failures:

  * ggCompNet: There was an error building the vignette, I looked into it but
    it seems to be unrelated to readr changes.

  * gsheet: Network failure when trying to retrieve a external resource.

  * gutenbergr: Network failure when trying to retrieve a external resource, duplicated on CRAN checks.

  * biomartr, farff, myTAI, tidyquant: I couldn't automatically install dependencies.

  * tidytext: Looked into failures, seem un-releated to readr.
