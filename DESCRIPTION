Title: Read Rectangular Text Data
Description: The goal of 'readr' is to provide a fast and friendly way to read
    rectangular data (like 'csv', 'tsv', and 'fwf'). It is designed to flexibly
    parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when
    data unexpectedly changes.
